# Synchronization of identical oscillators on a sphere: exact results with external forces and higher-order interactions - Datasets and Codes

The codes for simulations were written in Fortran and compiled with the Intel Fortran Compiler. Data analysis and figures were done Python 3.10 and the following open source libraries: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

In this repository we show codes for simulations and processing data, as well as datasets used.

The preprint is available at <[https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03476](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17255)>. The following `BibTeX` code can be used to cite it:
